# Assignment 1: Adaptive Autonomous Surveillance Robot for Indoor Environments with Energy Management

## ABSTRACT 

This assignment introduces an **Autonomous Surveillance Robot** designed for efficient navigation in a 2D indoor environment comprising four rooms and three corridors. Commencing in Phase 1, the robot initiates operations at the "E" location, awaiting instructions to construct a comprehensive topological map that delineates the spatial relationships between corridors (C1, C2), rooms (R1, R2, R3), and doors (D1...D6). This map serves as a foundational guide for the subsequent phases. In Phase 2, the robot executes a perpetual loop of movement and surveillance, adhering to a policy that prioritizes corridor traversal and periodic room exploration based on a predefined duration since the last visit. An autonomous robot return to the "E" location is triggered when the robot's battery level falls below a set threshold, enabling recharge before recommencing surveillance. By integrating adaptive topological mapping, energy management, and a surveillance policy, this autonomous surveillance robot emerges as a comprehensive solution for effective indoor security and surveillance applications, offering dynamic and responsive navigation capabilities within a controlled environment.
